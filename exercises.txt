7. the .h means header and contains functions that can be used in a function, they are written by other programmers
8. a linker links the object code with object code from the c++ standard library to create an application
9. a source file is a file that contains the written code while the object file is a file that is a result of compiling process with instructions that can be processed by the machine
10. IDE: intergrated development environment is used to help you write and run your programs efficiently by providing some guidance and autofills at some point. it is user friendly
11. practice helps you master the task at hand and to understand deeper the meaning of the task.
